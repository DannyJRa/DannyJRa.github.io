# How to run the select code in VScode?

I've noted that there is no default keybindings for command "Run Selected Text in Active Terminal" but you can create one.

Press Ctrl+K+S to open File->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts. Search for 'workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText' in keybindings. Press the icon on the left to open a windnow with this message "Press desired key combination..." and make your choice.

I've pressed Ctrl+Alt+R - as this combination was not used yet. Press Enter to store your keybinding.
