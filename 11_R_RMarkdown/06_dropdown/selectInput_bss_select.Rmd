## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(bsselectR)

quotes <- c("Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.", 
            "A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool.", 
            "My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, 
            some compassion, some humor, and some style.")

quotes <- setNames(quotes, c("Einstein", "Shakespeare", "Angelou"))

bsselect(quotes, type = "text", height = 200)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#devtools::install_github("walkerke/bsselectR")
```
