In this Scrapy tutorial, I will talk about how to create a Scrapy project and a Scrapy spider, in addition, I will show you how to use some basic scrapy commands.


## Create Simple Scrapy Project
Now we start to create a new scrapy project from scratch.
```{bash}
scrapy genspider quotes_spider quotes.toscrape.com
```
Now you have a scrapy project which contains a spider named quotes_spider.py.

```{bash}
scrapy crawl quotes_spider
```
