# Getting started with Django 

## Why Django

Django is a Web framework written in Python. A Web framework is a software that supports the development of dynamic Web sites, applications, and services. It provides a set of tools and functionalities that solves many common problems associated with Web development, such as security features, database access, sessions, template processing, URL routing, internationalization, localization, and much more.

Using a Web framework, such as Django, enables us to develop secure and reliable Web applications very quickly in a standardized way, without having to reinvent the wheel.

## Installation

The first thing we need to do is install some programs on our machine so to be able to start playing with Django. The basic setup consists of installing Python, Virtualenv, and Django.

Using virtual environments is not mandatory, but it’s highly recommended. 

Assuming python is installed (using 3.7.2 currently), we are going to use pipenv, a tool to manage and install Python packages with even more features thant just using virtuenv

```{bash, eval=F}
pip install pipenv
```















Think of it like this: for each Django project you start, you will first create a Virtual Environment for it. It’s like having a sandbox for each Django project. So you can play around, install packages, uninstall packages without breaking anything.

## Installing Django >2.0

Activated the virtual environment, run the following command to install Django:

```{bash, eval=F}
pip install django
```

## To start a New Project

To start a new Django project, run the command below:

```{bash, eval=F}
django-admin startproject admin_proj
```

Django comes with a simple web server installed. It’s very convenient during the development, so we don’t have to install anything else to run the project locally. We can test it by executing the command:

```{bash, eval=F}
python manage.py runserver
```


For now, you can ignore the migration errors; we will get to that later.

Now open the following URL in a Web browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000 and you should see the following page:

## Creating an App
        
In the Django philosophy we have two important concepts:

app: is a Web application that does something. An app usually is composed of a set of models (database tables), views, templates, tests.
project: is a collection of configurations and apps. One project can be composed of multiple apps, or a single app.


>django-admin startapp admin_app

This creates a folder structure for the app.



ow that we created our first app, let’s configure our project to use it.

To do that, open the settings.py and try to find the INSTALLED_APPS variable and include admin_app next to the 6 built-in apps

settings.py

```{python, eval=F}
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    
    'admin_app',
]
```
